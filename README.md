# MyPysparkProjects

##  Introduction
These are my Apache Spark Projects data analysis using Pyspark in Databricks.
The project run all Pyspark codes and SQL codes in Databricks.

Project 1: The Google Playstore Analysis\
Project 2: Sales Analysis
This second project also creates a dashboard in databricks and can be access through üëâ[Databricksdashboard](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1343429096759292/3078158866193990/6632974093078969/latest.html)    

The projects aim at showcasing hands-on experience in using Pyspark and SQL for data analysis. 
Additionally, it will also aid ongoing endeavors to understand the use of the cloud compute platform Databricks through data-driven insights. üåü

## Data Source:
The data used in these project are in the repository file also;  
* Project 1: Googleplaystore Sample Data [GoogleplaystoreData](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/googleplaystore.csv)
* Project 2: Sales Dataset [SalesTable](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/sales.csv.txt)
               Menu Dataset [MenuTable](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/menu.csv.txt)

## DE Technical Skills:

+ Exploratory Data Analyis (EDA)
+ SQL (JOINS, CTE ...)
+ Databricks
+ Data Visualization - dashboard
+ Feedback and Continuous Improvement
  
## Data Engineering Process
1. Check the notebook of first project on Googleplaystore here [Get the code here](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/Playstoreproject.ipynb) 
2. Check the notebook of second project on Sales Analysis here [Get the code here](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/Sales_Analysis%20with%20Pyspark.ipynb) 

## Data Visualization
The second Project is visualized with the Databricks dashboard platform and can be accessed here üëá

## Conclusions 
1. Databricks is one of the leading cloud big data platform as a service (PaaS) for big Data supporting both Python and SQL scripts.
2. It is awesome for Data warehousing and ETL process and simple visualization dashboard.

Thanks for taking time to go through this report! and I am open to collaborate with you on any Data Engineering projects exploring databricks or other cloud big data platforms especially Azure, AWS, GCP and Sniwflake, you can always reach me on adeoyerasheed30@gmail.com Ciao ü§ù
