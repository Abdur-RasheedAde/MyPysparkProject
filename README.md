# MyPysparkProjects

##  Introduction
These are my Apache Spark Projects data analysis using Pyspark in Databricks.
The project run all Pyspark codes and SQL codes in Databricks.

Project 1: The Google Playstore Analysis\
Project 2: Sales Analysis
This second project also creates a dashboard in databricks and can be access through üëâ[Databricksdashboard](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1343429096759292/3078158866193990/6632974093078969/latest.html)    

The projects aim at showcasing hands-on experience in using Pyspark and SQL for data analysis. 
Additionally, it will also aid ongoing endeavors to understand the use of the cloud compute platform Databricks through data-driven insights. üåü

## Data Source:
The data used in these project are in the repository file also;  
* Project 1: Googleplaystore Sample Data [GoogleplaystoreData](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/googleplaystore.csv)
* Project 2: Sales Dataset [SalesTable](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/sales.csv.txt)
               Menu Dataset [MenuTable](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MyPysparkProjects/blob/main/menu.csv.txt)

## DE Technical Skills:
+ Pyspark
+ Exploratory Data Analyis (EDA)
+ SQL (JOINS, CTE ...)
+ Databricks
+ Data Visualization - dashboard
+ Feedback and Continuous Improvement
  
## Data Engineering Process
1. Check the first Project Notebook here [Get the code here](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/Snowflake_Projects/blob/main/1.%20Schema_CREATION_and_Data_Injestion) 
2. Check the Second Project Notebook here [Get the code here](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/Snowflake_Projects/blob/main/1.%20Schema_CREATION_and_Data_Injestion) 

## Data Visualization
After all ETL process and data warehousing, some important metrics are visualized using the snowflake dashboard. This is a simple created dashboard with just 5 KPIs and can be accessed using the link below. However, this project was created using the free trial of snowflake and may not be accessible after 30 days of uplaod.

## Conclusions 
1. Snowflake is one of the leading cloud big data platform as a service (PaaS) for Data supporting both Python and SQL.
2. It is awesome for Data warehousing and ETL process and simple visualization dashboard.

Thanks for taking time to go through this report! and I am open to collaborate with you on any Data Engineering projects exploring snowflake or other cloud big data platforms especially Azure, AWS, GCP and Databricks, you can always reach me on adeoyerasheed30@gmail.com Ciao ü§ù
